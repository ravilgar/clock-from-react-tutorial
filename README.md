The clock ticks every second. I tried to repeat the react tutorial example myself.

# How To Use
1) Install packages through the node.js using the command "npm install"
2) Run the server through the node.js using the command "node server/server.js"
3) Open localhost:8080
4) * If you want to make any change, start webpack using "webpack --watch" command.
